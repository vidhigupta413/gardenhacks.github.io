        <li>Hydrangeas are a popular flowering  shrub. They have clusters of pink, blue, or white flowers which make the garden look beautiful with this plant displayed. They bloom in the beginning of summer and thrive long into the winter. Hydrangeas grow well in shaded areas.</li>
        <li> Hydrangeas are a poisonous species of garden plants that should be handled with great care. The most poison is found at the flower bud, even though the whole plant is toxic in general.</li>
        <li> It has almost the same severity as cyanide when the flowering shrub is swallowed in small quantities.Hydragin, a cyanogenic glycoside, is present in the plant. This will cause dizziness, shortness of breath, an acceleration of the pulse rate, and fainting with a significant drop in blood pressure after consuming it. Due to this, you will suffer seizures and eventually die.</li>

   <li>Poinsettia is one of the most popular garden shrubs, as it is known for its red leaves. It tends to be popular during the holiday season in warm, subtropical climates, like southern california. The leaves of the plant are generally used for  leaf wreaths, dining room table setting, and fireplace mantel decorations.</li>
   <li>Poinsettia veins have a milky sap that contains toxins which are poisonous if eaten. They arenâ€™t necessarily deadly, as there were only 2 reported cases where poinsettia caused 2 human deaths.</li>
   <li>Children and pets should be supervised when being near the plant. If consumed, they may experience diarrhea or nausea. You should be extra careful if you have ill, elderly, or young pets at home.</li>

<ul style= "position:absolute; top:1650px; left: 250px;">
  <li> Yew shrubs are very adaptable and can be grown in shade or sun. They are one of the few plants that can be grown in the shade which makes them ideal for beginners or gardeners with inadequate brightness. However, this plant can be deadly as the needle-like leaves and the bright red berries are extremely toxic. Although those are the most dangerous parts, the whole yew shrub is poisonous. As a safety precaution you should keep this plant away from any children or pets that may try to ingest it.</li>

<ul style="position:absolute; top:2150px; left:250px;">
  <li>Poison Ivy is a plant whose dangerous reputation precedes it. It grows all throughout the continental United States. Although most common in its singular plant form, it can also grow as a vine or a small shrub which can grow on the ground, in the trees, or even on poles. You can recognise this plant from their glossy leaves in three leaflets. Although many people think that they can identify poison ivy by its green color, in the spring the leaves turn red and in the fall they turn yellow, orange, or red. They only stay green during the summer months. The plant also has light green flowers and white berries.</li>
  <li>Despite some rumors, the rash cannot be transferred from one person to another. However, if the plant oil seeps into clothing, on your pets, or into your garden tools, it is possible to get a rash. Oils from poison ivy can potentially remain on surfaces for multiple years, but you can easily get them out by using water or rubbing alcohol.</li> 
  <li> A person can't spread the poison ivy around their body by scratching. When the plant oil comes into contact with the skin, the rash starts to form. A rash that appears gradually might look like it is spreading across the body, but it is just appearing at different times in different areas.This may be due to the plant oil being absorbed at varying rates on parts of the body, or it may be because of repeated exposure to objects that are contaminated or plant oil under the fingernail. Although the blisters may rip apart, the fluid that is inside does not have plant oil and cannot be spread.</li>
